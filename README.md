# Gloomy Collector Overview
My project will be a website that will allow Gloomy Bear collectors to view a stored record of every Gloomy Bear item created. It will allow users to log in and save their own private collection. The project will also allow users to submit other Gloomy Bear items that are not yet listed or might have missing information. 

This project was motivated by the need for Gloomy Bear collectors to have a reliable database to keep track of all Gloomy Bear items as well as their own personal collections.
